You will find my Jupyter Notebook in this repository, as well as the datasets that I used for the analysis. 

## Data

The repository includes the raw data files from the 2008, 2012, and 2016 American National Election Studies. Each year has two files: the survey dataset *without* the redacted responses to the open-ended questiosn and an Excel spreadsheet with the open-ended responses. The files that have "raw data" in their name are the survey data files without the redacted open-ended response text. If you go to the [American National Election Studies](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/) data center, you will find the same survey data files and open-ended response Excel spreadsheets. Please note that I posed my versions of the open-ended response spreadsheets. They contain the original textual data in the format that ANES provided them in, but I copied and pasted the columns that I wanted into new worksheets to make it easier to read them into Pandas.
